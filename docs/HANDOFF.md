git clone https://github.com/Ayush-o1/contextforge.git
cd contextforge

# 2. Set up Python environment
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Verify everything works
PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/ -v   # should be 84/84

# 4. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Add your OPENAI_API_KEY

# 5. Start Redis
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine

## What Works Right Now

1. **`POST /v1/chat/completions`** — Full OpenAI-compatible endpoint
2. **Semantic caching** — FAISS + Redis, cosine similarity with adaptive threshold (default 0.92)
3. **Model routing** — Rule-based classifier: simple → gpt-3.5-turbo, complex → gpt-4o (92.8% accuracy)
4. **Context compression** — Long conversations automatically summarized to reduce token usage
5. **Telemetry** — Per-request metrics logged to SQLite (model, latency, cost, cache hit, compression)
6. **Adaptive thresholds** — Auto-tune cache similarity threshold based on hit rates
7. **Cache invalidation** — `DELETE /v1/cache`, `DELETE /v1/cache/{key}`, `GET /v1/cache/stats`
8. **Streaming** — SSE passthrough (bypasses cache and compression by design)
9. **Error propagation** — Upstream 4xx/5xx errors surface correctly
10. **Benchmark suite** — 1000-prompt dataset, E2E benchmark runner with `--dry-run` for CI
11. **Dashboard** — Built-in HTML dashboard at `GET /dashboard`
12. **Health check** — `GET /health` returns `{"status":"ok","version":"0.7.0"}`
13. **Telemetry API** — `GET /v1/telemetry` (paginated) + `GET /v1/telemetry/summary` (aggregated)
14. **Threshold API** — `GET /v1/threshold` + `POST /v1/threshold/evaluate`

## Known Gotchas

### 1. `get_settings()` uses `@lru_cache`

Settings are loaded once from `.env` and cached for the process lifetime. Changes at runtime won't take effect until restart. In tests, force reload with:

```python
from app.config import get_settings
get_settings.cache_clear()
```

### 2. FAISS index has a companion file

The FAISS index and its ID map are two separate files:
- `data/faiss.index` — the vector index
- `data/faiss.index.idmap` — JSON mapping of index positions to cache keys

**Both files must be moved, deleted, or backed up together.** If one is missing, cache lookups will return wrong results.

### 3. Streaming bypasses cache and compression

When `stream=True`, the request goes straight to the proxy — no cache lookup, no cache store, no compression. This is by design (streaming responses can't be easily cached).

### 4. Embedder uses deferred import

`app/embedder.py` imports `sentence-transformers` inside `__init__()`, not at module level. This allows tests to import the module without the heavy ML library. Don't move the import to the top of the file.

### 5. Router defaults to COMPLEX when ambiguous

If the router can't confidently classify a prompt, it returns `COMPLEX`. This is intentional — it's safer to use a better model than risk quality issues.

### 6. Compression requires both thresholds

Compression only triggers when the conversation exceeds `CONTEXT_COMPRESSION_THRESHOLD_TOKENS` (default: 2000) **AND** has more than `COMPRESSION_MIN_TURNS` (default: 6) turns. Both conditions must be true.

### 7. Compression failure never blocks a request

If compression fails (LLM error, timeout, etc.), the request silently falls back to uncompressed messages. Check `compression_ratio` in telemetry — a value of `1.0` means compression was skipped or failed.

### 8. Telemetry uses SQLite WAL mode

`app/telemetry.py` enables WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) for concurrent writes. The database file may have accompanying `-wal` and `-shm` files. Don't delete them while the server is running.

### 9. Cost estimates are approximate

The `estimated_cost_usd` field uses hardcoded per-token rates in `app/costs.py`. These are estimates — actual billing from OpenAI may differ slightly.

### 10. `X-ContextForge-No-Compress` header

Set `X-ContextForge-No-Compress: true` on any request to bypass compression entirely. Useful for debugging or when you need exact message control.

### 11. Adaptive threshold has min/max caps

The threshold self-tunes between `ADAPTIVE_THRESHOLD_MIN` (0.70) and `ADAPTIVE_THRESHOLD_MAX` (0.98). Step size is ±0.01 per evaluation. Hit rate thresholds: >60% → raise, <20% → lower.

### 12. Cache endpoints handle Redis unavailability

`GET /v1/cache/stats` and `DELETE /v1/cache` return partial results (vector count but 0 Redis keys) if Redis is not running. Errors are logged but don't crash the endpoint.

### 13. `datetime.utcnow()` deprecation

`app/adaptive.py` uses `datetime.datetime.utcnow()` which shows a DeprecationWarning on Python 3.12+. Can be fixed by switching to `datetime.datetime.now(datetime.UTC)`.

### 14. Dashboard is a static site

The dashboard lives at `docs/dashboard/index.html`. It is a standalone static web app — no server-side rendering, no build step. It connects to `http://localhost:8000` for live data and falls back to mock data when the backend is unavailable. See [docs/DASHBOARD.md](DASHBOARD.md) for the full architecture.

### 15. Telemetry is local-only

All telemetry is stored locally in SQLite at `./data/telemetry.db`. No request data is sent to any external service.
